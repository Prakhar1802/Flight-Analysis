# Flight Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Flight Data Analysis project! This project involves comprehensive analysis and visualization of flight-related data to derive insights across various aspects of flights.

## Overview

This project utilizes Python and essential libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and NumPy to explore and analyze a dataset encompassing flight details. The dataset covers factors such as gender, nationality, flight status, pilots, airports, continents, and more.

## Dataset

- The dataset used in this project is not included due to size limitations but can be obtained from [source location].

## Project Structure

- `data_frame_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.0 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Prakhar1802/Flight-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Open `data_frame_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook.

3. Run each cell in the notebook to perform the data analysis and visualize insights.

## Analysis Highlights

- **Age Group Analysis**: Segmentation of passengers into adult and teenager groups.
- **Nationality Insights**: Top nationalities among adults and teenagers.
- **Gender Analysis**: Flight data distribution based on gender.
- **Flight Status Overview**: Distribution and insights on flight statuses.
- **Pilot and Airport Insights**: Top pilots and airports affecting flight statuses.
- **Continental Impact**: Flight statuses across different continents.
- **Monthly Flight Statuses**: Variation of flight statuses across months.

## Visualizations

The notebook includes various visual representations like bar graphs, pie charts, and line plots to enhance data understanding.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides insights into flight patterns, influencing factors, and demographics, offering a comprehensive view of flight operations.

Feel free to explore the notebook for detailed analysis!
